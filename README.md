## Features

- Monitors audio playback through Bluetooth device
- Choose device through Bluetooth device name
- Automatically disconnects Bluetooth headphones after a user-defined period of inactivity
- Lightweight and low resource usage

## Use-Case

AutoBTDisconnect is particularly helpful for users of Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones on Windows computers. As there is no
native Headphones Connect app for Windows, the auto-power off functionality is only enabled when the headphones are
disconnected from the computer. This application proves to be valuable for individuals who leave their machines running
for extended periods without an auto-sleep rule (e.g., when running long workloads). By using AutoBTDisconnect, they can
save battery life on their headphones while ensuring seamless connectivity when needed.

## Requirements

- Works on Windows 11
